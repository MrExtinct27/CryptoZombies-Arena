## üìñ Project Description

CryptoZombies Arena is a comprehensive blockchain-based gaming DApp built on Ethereum. This project transforms the basic CryptoZombies starter code into a fully-featured NFT game with marketplace capabilities, battle system, breeding mechanics, and real-time leaderboards. Players can create zombies, breed them to create offspring with custom names, engage in battles, trade zombies in an NFT marketplace, and compete on global leaderboards.

The application demonstrates full-stack blockchain development with smart contract interaction, Web3 integration, and modern frontend design principles.
